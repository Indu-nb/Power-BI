This project was divided into two parts- sales performance dashbaord and individual retailer performance dashboard.
New AI tools like Q&A and Key influencers were used to make the dashboard more interactive and understand the key drivers behind operating profit.

We were able to answer the below questions through visualization:
1. Which is a better performing channel in terms of profit and sales volume? What is the distribution of these channels among the different retailers?
2. How can we rank the product assortments along best selling and most profitable parameter?
3. What is the most profitable region for Adidas by Sales and Profit Margin and which region requires attention?
4. What is the product assortment, profit margin and contribution of each individual retailer (through DAX)?
5. What is YoY trend for each retailer on profit, revenue, sale volume (through DAX)?
6. How do the retailers perform on important KPIs like revenue and Sales Volume? Locate them in a range and compute the average?
7. Calculate the Sale Volume and Profit Margin (through DAX) for each retailer?
8. Calculate Profit Margin % by Sales Method, Region, State and City for each retailer.
9. Do a Product Profitabiility Analysis (Profit Per Unit through DAX) and draw an average Sale Volume flow in a week through DAX?
10. Do a revenue-trend analysis for each retailer.
